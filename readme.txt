In a nutshell, this program randomizes all the GD textures.
To keep things tidy, textures will only be replaced with similar-sized ones.
All icons are also randomized.
It's also compatible with texture packs!

HOW TO USE:
- Run the "shuffle.exe" file.
- When it finishes, drag the files in the "pack" folder into your GD resources folder.
- When asked to overwrite files, click yes.
